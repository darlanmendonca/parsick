Parse any data sick and select only the healthy fields

## What's is Parsick?

Parsick is an easy way to parse any data and select only a set of fields of data.   
Some data have a lot of useless data for you (sick (: ) and sometimes is painful and parse it for a useful data (healthy) for your purpose.

## Usage

**NOTE**: If your data have nested fields, they will to the root. To see more complex examples, see the test.

```javascript
'use strict';

var Parsick = require('parsick');

var parsick = new Parsick();

// Parse sick JSON
let jsonSample = {mark: 1, marquee: 2};

// Get healthy data
let result = parsick.parse('json', jsonSample, 'mark');
// result: [ { mark: 1 } ]

// Parse sick XML
let xmlSample = '<root><mark>1</mark><marquee>2</marquee></root>';

// Get healthy data
result = parsick.parse('xml', xmlSample, 'mark')
// result: [ { mark: 1 } ]

```

**NOTE**: At this time just XML and JSON can be parsed. But you can simply create yours own adapters for parse your format (see below).

## Public Methods

## Constructor(adapters)

By default we load all adapters in `adapters` directory. If specified just adapters is used.

  - **adapters** : This argument must be an `Object` with keys is adapters' name and value a `function` with the logic to parse data. See more example in `adapters` directory.

  **example**
  ```javascript
    let adapters = {
      json: (source, fields) => { return fields; } // dummy example
    }
  ``` 

### parse(type, sourceData, fields)

Parse the `sourceData` and return only the specified `fields`.

  - **type** : The type of data in `sourceData` currently is supported only: JSON and XML.
  - **sourceData** : Sick data to be parsed.
  - **fields** : Wanted fields for the new healthy data.
